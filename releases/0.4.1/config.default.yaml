# certificate names are specified below. Otherwise app is started with http
# WARNING: You should obtain a valid certificate immediately to avoid loss
# of data confidentiality.
# Additionally, key and certificate downloads via the API key will be disabled
# if the server is running as http.

# API Server's key and cert
# These names should match the 'name' field of the desired key and cert within
# the application.
# If not specified (or invalid), a self-signed cert is created on each launch
# until proper values are specified.
