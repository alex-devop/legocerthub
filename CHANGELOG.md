# LeGo CertHub Changelog

## [v0.6.9] - 2023-01-29

### Added
- Config option to disable dns checker module. Instead, specify a time to sleep and
  then assume dns propagated successfully.
- Manual DNS script challenge validation module. Calls external scripts to create
  and remove DNS records. This allows support for any DNS provider. Add example scripts
  to show variables available to scripts.
- Add some more config comments on dns checker config.

### Changed
- Better logging for config parsing.
- Better authentication logging for audit trail.
- Better download logging for audit trail.
- Exit on improperly formatted config.yaml

### Fixed
- Fix install and upgrade linux scripts to work when called from any path.
- Fix logic auto order logic that could sometimes result in the job being called
  twice on the same day.
- Include subject in the CSR DNSNames field (not just Alt Names). LE accepted the
  previous method but Pebble returns an error without this.
- Frontend: Fix missing Staging Flag in All Certificates.
- Frontend: Fix wrong information in confirm delete certificate Dialog.
